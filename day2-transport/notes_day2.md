# Day 2 – TCP/UDP & Ports

## What I studied
- TCP vs UDP
- Common ports (20–3389)
- TCP 3-way handshake
- DHCP & DNS flows

## Labs completed
- Captured TCP handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK)
- Captured DNS query/response (youtube.com)
- Captured DHCP DORA process

## Flashcards
- 23 cards created (ports, handshake, NAT/PAT, DNS/DHCP)
