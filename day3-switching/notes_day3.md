What's a VLAN:
a virtual LAN is a way to logically devide a single physical network switch into ultiple, seperate virtual networks.

Why hosts in different VLANs canâ€™t talk without a router:
because a switch only forward a traffic within the same VLAN, if a Host A whant to send traffic to another Host B in a diferent subnet (diferent VLAN) it needs to send the traffic to its default gateway (router or layer 3 device), the router cheks its routing table hOST B IP adresse and then forward the traffic to the correct subnet/VLAN
